# React Game Hub
This is a simple static website as part of my React learning journey. I had previously deployed it on [Vercel](vercel.com).

### Prequisites
Create a `.env` file in the main directory and add the [RAWG Video Games Database](https://rawg.io/apidocs) API (free)

```VITE_RAWG_API_KEY=<API_KEY>```
